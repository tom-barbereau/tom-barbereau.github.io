[The Religion of Technology](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/331339/the-religion-of-technology-by-david-f-noble/) by _David Noble_ (1999): The book "demonstrates that modern man’s enchantment with things technological was inspired by and grounded in religious expectations and the quest for transcendence and salvation."
