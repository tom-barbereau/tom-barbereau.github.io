[The Net Delusion](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10003400) by _Evgeny Morozov_ (2010): The book argues that "by falling for the supposedly democratising nature of the Internet, we may have missed how it also entrenches dictators, threatens dissidents, and makes it harder - not easier - to promote democracy."

[Life 3.0](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34272565) by _Max Tegmark_ (2017): The book does not "shy away from the full range of viewpoints or from the most controversial issues -- from superintelligence to meaning, consciousness and the ultimate physical limits on life in the cosmos."

[Who Rules the World?](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250131089/whorulestheworld) by _Noam Chomsky_ (2017): The book offers a "probing examination of the nature of U.S. policies post-9/11, and the perils of valuing power above democracy and human rights."

[The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/?lens=publicaffairs) by _Shoshana Zuboff_ (2019): The book argues that a "global architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth."
