My academic path was determined early. I come from privilege; one where my grandparents enjoyed an academic education, and so did their kids - my parents. All of them - willingly or unwillingly - fostered in me a pragmatic outlook.

My grandfather (1934-2023), a physicist by training who wrote his PhD against the use of ABC weapons, worked at the CERN, the Fraunhofer Institute, and eventually retired as an advocate for peace, de-nucleraisation and foreign aid.[^1] He would watch over me doing homework, occasionally help out, although mostly requiring me to consider where I would study before I could distinguish a fraction from a derivative. My other grandfather (1944), a historian by training, worked for the French government and helped to set up tertiary education in post-Soviet states. His influence has been less formal in that sense; he always emphasised the connection to nature, neighbours, peers, and the simple needs of life. In some way he certainly has traits of a cynic. 

[^1]: Refer to the transcript of his speech (in German) at the [Federation of German Scientists](https://vdw-ev.de/dirk-michael-harmsen-erinnerungen-an-eigene-arbeiten-friedens-und-konfliktforschung/). 

As I left school and choose to study abroad with the full support of my parents, I soon learned about the human complexity of society, economy, and everything else around. I learned of this complexity - and the role individuals play in it - even more so as I too began with a PhD. 'Things' are not always what they seem; “decentralisation” does not equate distribution; “sovereignty” (of the self) does [not equate empowerment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X23000734); perspectives and thoughts, losses and benefits differ according to the eye of the beholder. Cynicism is needed. 

Following an academic path enabled me to scratch the surface of things I care about; things I thought to benefit the many, but soon realised that actually benefit the few. For instance, I believed that the blockchain warrants 'desirable' social values and actually 'improves' things. As I showed in my work, [reality is different](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X23000568). The interest of the few (always?) triumphs over that of the many. The metaverse, another technology I studied, [is no different](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00612-z) to that axiom. 

The critical view I have of technology, the pragmatism that guides my research, work, and outlook has become a raison d’être - a reason to be - in the metaphysical sense. I ask [the uncomfortable questions](https://tom-barbereau.github.io/thoughts/2024/08/02/why-technology.html).
