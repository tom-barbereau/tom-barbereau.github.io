Regularly, I talk at academic conference, lecture students, or speak at professional events. As per occassion, I address the different audiences at different levels of complexity.

The theme uniting all of my talks is the critical perspective I bring to the discussion of technologies. I go beyond the surface-level fascination with innovation and progress to explore the deeper implications of technology. I emphasise the importance of questioning the [political](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20024652?origin=JSTOR-pdf) of technologies. By examining the political and the exercise of actors' power, I encourage my audience to consider how these tools shape our lives and (subconsciously) influence our decisions.
