Regularly, I talk at academic conference, lecture students, or speak at professional events. As per occasion, I address the different audiences at different levels of complexity.

I go beyond the surface-level fascination with innovation and progress to explore their deeper implications. I emphasise the importance of questioning the [political](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20024652?origin=JSTOR-pdf) and, by examining it and the exercise of actors' power, I encourage my audience to consider how technologies shape our lives and (subconsciously) influence our decisions.
