I'm a scientist specialist at the Dutch Organisation for Applied Scientific Research ([TNO](tno.nl)) and research fellow at the Institute for Information Law ([IViR](https://www.ivir.nl/)). I am born in Karlsruhe, Germany and was raised in a bilingual household (French, German). Since 2022, I live in Amsterdam.

## Research
By trianing and passion, I am a critical technologist. I ask the uncomfortable questions, doubt the deterministic narratives presented, and challenge the premises upon which a technological problem-solution rests. Though a specialist in the `digital' realm, I am still agnostic towards which actually technology in particular I work on. 

My strength lies in cross-disciplinary collaboration, to find logical relations between topics, and to untangle socio-technological controversies. I collaborate with lawyers, mathematicians, and computer scientists, and choose outlets that match the critical nature of my work. Among ohters, I published in:

- [Technology in Society](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2023.102251)
- [Philosophy & Technology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00612-z)
- [Government Information Quarterly](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2023.101873)
- [Computer Law and Security Review](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105829)
- [Academy for Computing Machinery](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649318)

You can also find my work in international conferences and edited books. My most up-to-date portfolio is on [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qvsfsEMAAAAJ&hl=en).

Regularly, I talk at academic conference, lecture students, or speak at professional events. As per occasion, I address the different audiences at different levels of complexity. You can check out a list of them [here](/talks/).

In the style of [Jathan Sadowski](https://www.jathansadowski.com/), I too wrote up a series of thoughts on how I think about the politics and power of technology. Like for Jathan, I believe it of value given that I am frequently asked why I study technology in the first place and, more provocatively, what my contribution might even be as a `non-technical', social scientist. You can read these thoughts of mine [here](/tags/thoughts/).


## Education

I earned my PhD in Information Systems Management from the University of Luxembourg (Thesis: "[Politics, Power, and Information Systems](https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/58926)") as part of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust ([SnT](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/)). I hold an MSc in Science & Technology Studies from the University of Edinburgh (Thesis: "Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Convoluted Narratives of Decentralisation") and a BA in Liberal Arts & Sciences from the University of Groningen (Thesis: "Challenging Habermasian Deliberation on Facebook").


## Miscellaneous

I have had the opportunity to write for press and contribute to printed magazines reflecting some of my personal interests. I have written for the design and typography magazine Slanted Issues [#34 - Europe](https://slanted.de/slanted-34-europe/), [#36 - Coexist](https://slanted.de/slanted-36-coexist/), and [#37 - Artificial intelligence](https://www.slanted.de/product/slanted-magazine-37-ai/) as well as for the lifestyle magazine [Jocks & Nerds](https://www.gleditions.com/post/interview-with-jocks-and-nerds-gary-lichtenstein.).
