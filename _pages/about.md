I'm a scientist specialist at the [Dutch Organisation for Applied Scientific Research](tno.nl) (TNO) as part of the unit on ICT, Strategy, and Policy. I earned my PhD in information systems management from the University of Luxembourg (Thesis: [Politics, Power, and Information Systems](https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/58926)) as part of the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/) (SnT). I hold an MSc in Science & Technology Studies from the University of Edinburgh and a BA in Liberal Arts & Sciences from the University of Groningen.

### Academic interests

My research principally focused on three technologies – blockchain, identity systems, and the metaverse – which I approach in a critical manner. As visiting researcher, I spent time at the [Institute for Information Law](https://www.ivir.nl/) (IViR), University of Amsterdam to work on questions of technology, governance, and the law.

Having successfully collaborated with lawyers, mathematicians, and computer scientists, my strength lies in cross-disciplinary collaboration, to find logical relations between topics, and to untangle socio-technological controversies. I published impactful research in [Technology in Society](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2023.102251), [Philosophy & Technology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00612-z), [Government Information Quarterly](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2023.101873), [Computer Law and Security Review](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105829), and the [Academy for Computing Machinery](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649318) among other contributions made in international conferences and edited books. You can find my most up-to-date portfolio on [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qvsfsEMAAAAJ&hl=en).

Regularly, I talk at academic conference, lecture students, or speak at professional events. As per occasion, I address the different audiences at different levels of complexity. You can check out a list of them [here](/talks/).

Finally, in the style of [Jathan Sadowski](https://www.jathansadowski.com/), I too wrote up a personal statement on how I think about the politics and power of technology. Like for Jathan, I believe it of value given that as social scientist I am frequently asked why I study technology in the first place and, more provocatively, what my contribution might even be as a \`non-technical' guy. You can read this statement, along with other thoughts of mine, [here](/tags/thoughts/).

### Personal interests

Over the years I had the opportunity to write for press and contribute to printed magazines.
